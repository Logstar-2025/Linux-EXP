# Linux-EXP
I want to make a version of linux that can run windows programs from initial start up and throughout use of the operating system, i also want to make it so that it is just as reliable as windows XP, has the features of windows 10 or more, and has the versatility of windows 11 on the laptop side. any ideas? It would be very appreciated.
